# tour-intelligence-qloo — Qloo Agentic Hackathon Submission

## What this is
Tour Intelligence × Qloo: "Don't just find your fans. Win their city." A taste-powered planning system for live music tours (film press tours secondary) that scores where an artist can **win** (fan heat + activation potential) and produces a per-city activation playbook and a Tour & Activation Book. Upgraded from the Google "Agentic Cinema" submission (`prats-2311/google_promotions`, left untouched).

## Source of truth
- Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-16-tour-intelligence-qloo-design.md`
- Plans: `docs/superpowers/plans/`
- Hackathon: qloo.devpost.com — deadline 2026-10-30 23:45 ET (2026-10-31 09:15 IST). Criteria (equal weight, tie-break order): Technological Implementation, Design, Potential Impact, Quality of the Idea.

## Decisions (don't relitigate without new info)
- Qloo access only via `cloud_run/qloo_gateway` (Node, because the Qloo harness / `qloo mcp` is Node-only). The old "no Node stack" rule is superseded for this service only.
- Scores are deterministic code, never LLM output; missing data ⇒ `insufficient_data`.
- LLM narrative claims pass grounding verification; failing claims are removed, never rewritten.
- Mobile-first responsive UI in the existing Premiere Noir system.
- Process: Superpowers workflow (TDD, subagent-driven development with Sonnet subagents, verification before completion); Graft for code navigation; UI tasks read frontend-design, ui-ux-pro-max, taste-skill.

## Nested guides
Existing per-directory `CLAUDE.md` files remain authoritative for their services; `cloud_run/qloo_gateway/CLAUDE.md` covers the gateway.

## Tests
`./run_tests.sh` runs pytest, dashboard vitest, gateway vitest, and `graft check`. Must be green before every commit.
